# Red Flag Repository (it is not about cyber security.)

Disclaimer: I've made this as an assignement in social media data analytics class, but the idea was inspired by my CIA-level stalker friends who were searching manually whether their significant other followed people with OFs. Please do not take this all too seriously, I personally do not mind OFs (get the bag), following strangers on IG, or explicit hashtags, but in the end, I'm just here to automate specific searches.

These tools help to find out whether they:

• follow people with an OF

• follow accounts that do not follow them back (aka strangers)

• follow certain hashtags (interchange the content you are looking for)
