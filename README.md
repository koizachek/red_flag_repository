# Red Flag Repository (it is not about cyber security.)

Disclaimer: I've made this as an assignement in social media data analytics class, but the idea was inspired by my CIA-level stalker friends who are searching for f*ck/girl/boy evidence online. Please do not take this repository too seriously, I personally do not mind OFs (get the bag), following strangers on IG, or explicit hashtags, but in the end, most people would search for it anyways, and I'm just here to automate that because ain't no way that I'll do another twitter sentiment analysis, what a boring presentation that would be.

OK NOW: a couple of scraping tools I developed for my friends who want to know whether they're dating walking red flags.
These tools help you to find out whether you or anyone you know:

• follows people with an OF

• follows accounts that do not follow them back

• follows certain hashtags (interchange the content you are looking for)


If you have any other needs, feel free to message me, I would love to hear the lore.
